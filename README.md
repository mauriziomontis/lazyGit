# lazyGit  

Set of scripts (I hope) used to spend less time typing git commands.
No particular interest in making something sublime, just something functional.


## Usage

Clone the repository in some place in your system and create a symbolic link in your binary folder (such as /sur/bin or /usr/local/bin).

Steps:
1. Clone the repo
```
cd /your/favourite/folder
git clone https://github.com/mauriziomontis/lazyGit.git
```

2. Create symbolic links 
```
ln -s /your/favourite/folder/lazyGit/git-pull-directories.sh /usr/local/bin/lazyGit-pull-directories.sh
```

3. Two steps are enough!



## List of Scripts

### lazyGit-pull-directories.sh - pull all projects in one command 

Execute pull command for all sub-folders which include .git, avoiding to do it one by one.

And yes, I'm lazy!
